# matlabLife

Collected matlab projects and labs created mainly during University studies in Engineering Physics / Computational Physics.

## Description

In this repository you can find solutions to problems in various applications of computational programming. For most reusable and generic functions, I would suggest taking a look at optimiAlgos, MatrixComp and CompMeth.
